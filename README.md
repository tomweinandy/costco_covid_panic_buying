# Quantifying Retail Panic Buying using Mobile Device Data
By Tom Weinandy, Data Scientist at [BlueGranite](https://www.blue-granite.com/about).

* This notebook is a demo associated with my [blog post](https://www.bluegranite.com/blog/quantifying-retail-panic-buying-using-mobile-device-data) of the same name. Check it out!
* The notebook requires data from [SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/). I do not have permission to share the csv files I use; however, a quick internet search will review some discount codes to try your own sample.
* For those using their own downloaded data, I included the #edit comment where you will have to make your own edits.
